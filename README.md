# Final Project of the Deep Learning subject

Hello! This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook that we used for our final project in the Deep Learning subject, which was ministrated by professor Ivanovitch Silva.
To execute our notebook and see for yourself, you can create a copy of it in your Google Colab, or maybe execute the notebook in a Jupyter environment. 
Also, you might need to check the installed libraries on the code and manually install them in your environment.
