# Final Project of the Deep Learning subject

Hello! This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook that we used for our final project in the Deep Learning subject, which was ministrated by professor Ivanovitch Silva.
To execute our notebook and see for yourself, you can create a copy of it in your Google Colab, or maybe execute the notebook in a Jupyter environment. 
Also, you might need to check the installed libraries on the code and manually install them in your environment.

## The Dataset
We got our dataset from kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sanikamal/horses-or-humans-dataset "Kaggle dataset"). Horses or Humans is a dataset of 300Ã—300 images, created by Laurence Moroney, that is licensed CC-By-2.0 for anybody to use in learning or testing computer vision algorithms.
The set contains 500 rendered images of various species of horse in various poses in various locations. It also contains 527 rendered images of humans in various poses and locations. Emphasis has been taken to ensure diversity of humans, and to that end there are both men and women as well as Asian, Black, South Asian and Caucasians present in the training set. The validation set adds 6 different figures of different gender, race and pose to ensure breadth of data.
